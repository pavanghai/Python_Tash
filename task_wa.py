###WEEKEND ACTIVITY ON DATA STRUCTURES
"""

# alphabet if it exists in the string with their index.

# 8. Write a program in Python to iterate through the 
# string “hello my name is Abcde” and print the string which has even length of the word.

# 9. Write a program in python to print the pair of numbers whose sum is equal 
# to result number that is let's say 8. x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,-1]

'''
10. Write a program in Python to complete the following task: Create two different 
lists as in even_list and odd_list Ask the user to enter the number in the 
range of 1,50 and make sure if the entered number is even appended it to the 
even_list and if the entered number is odd append it to the odd list. Keep that 
in mind you can only add 5 items in each list Make sure once you entered the total 
5 elements calculate the sum of the list and return the maximum out of the list.
'''

'''
11. Write a program to find out the occurrence of a specific word from an 
alphanumeric statement. Example: 12abcbacbaba344ab

          Output: a=5 b=5 c=2 make sure you should avoid the numbers in you logic
'''

# 12. Generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
